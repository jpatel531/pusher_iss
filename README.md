# Realtime International Space Station API

It's my first week at Pusher and, intrigued by Pusher's realtime Reddit feed, I wanted to have a go at making my first Websockets API. Being a huge fan of AngularJS, I also wanted to see for myself how simple it is to make it realtime with Pusher's new Angular library. 

NASA, with space always being one of my great fascinations, seemed a great place to turn to. Upon visiting NASA's data bank, I found Open-Notify.org had crunched NASA's raw International Space Station location data into a JSON API. Perfect, I thought, as it would be a chance to get some frequently updated data and stream it with the power of Websockets.
